# Arduino-Force-Feedback-Yoke 
CAD Files for GAGAGU FFB Flight Sim Yoke

I am going to try and update as much as I can so that We have everything needed to complete the new V2 project. 

I am not the create nor the designer of this project all credit goes to the wonderful creators https://github.com/jwryan4 & https://github.com/gagagu

They have done some amazing work and this is just me trying to make it easier for us as plebs to create their awesome project


One of the massive changes is the arrival of the rotary encoders. 

I am not as smart as I would like to be when it comes to making theses kinds of things but JR4 is, the way you need to wire the new encoders to the exsiting circutry is as follows and I Quote:

"There is no need for centre posn sensors as the rotary encoders provide better tracking accuracy than previous versions (v1.x). Use the same pcb. Rotary encoders connect to pin headers ROLL 1/ROLL 2 and PITCH1/PITCH2.  My encoders have 4 wires, BLK (gnd), RED (+V), GRN (phase1 out), WHT (phase2 out).  Connect GRN to PITCH1/ROLL1, WHT to PITCH2/ROLL2." - JR4

This one line of information is what should be able to take you from V1.3 to V2!!
